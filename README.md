## Overview

Label Consistent Fisher Vectors (LCFV) is a method for adding supervised information to Fisher vectors. This package is a standalone MATLAB/Octave implementation of LCFV, which allows you to compute a transformation matrix to be applied to Fisher vectors, taking the original Fisher vectors and class labels as input.

This package provides a complete pipeline for:
1.  **Feature Extraction**: Dense SIFT descriptors.
2.  **Encoding**: Fisher Vector encoding (GMM + PCA).
3.  **Optimization**: Learning the LCFV transformation matrix.


## Installation

Simply clone the repository. The code is written in pure MATLAB/Octave and requires no external compilation.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/wq2012/LCFV.git
```

## Demos

We provide three levels of demos:

1.  **Synthetic End-to-End**: `code/run_synthetic_end2end_demo.m`
    -   Generates synthetic data, trains GMM, computes FV, and applies LCFV.
2.  **CIFAR-10 Subset Real World**: `code/run_cifar10_end2end_demo.m`
    -   Extracts Dense SIFT from a subset of CIFAR-10 images, computes FV, and applies LCFV.
3.  **LCFV Core**: `code/run_LCFV_demo.m`
    -   Shows how to use `solve_LCFV1` and `solve_LCFV2` on pre-computed descriptors.

## Usage

### 1. Extract Features & Compute Fisher Vectors

You can use the built-in tools in `code/fisher_vector/` to generate features from images.

```matlab
addpath(genpath('code'));

% 1. Extract Dense SIFT from an image
img = imread('image.jpg');
descs = compute_dense_sift(img); % 128 x N matrix

% 2. Train GMM and PCA (using a set of training descriptors)
% all_descs: 128 x N_total matrix
K = 64; % Number of Gaussian components
pca_dim = 64; % PCA dimension
[w, mu, sigma, pca_transform, pca_mean] = fv_train(all_descs, K, pca_dim);

% 3. Encode Fisher Vector for a new image
% img_descs: 128 x N descriptors for the image
% Apply PCA projection first
img_descs_pca = pca_transform * bsxfun(@minus, img_descs, pca_mean);
% Encode
fv = fv_encode(img_descs_pca, w, mu, sigma);
```

### 2. Apply Label Consistent Fisher Vectors (LCFV)

Once you have Fisher Vectors for your training set, you can learn the LCFV transformation.

```matlab
% G: D x N matrix of Fisher Vectors (column vectors)
% labels: N x 1 vector of class labels
% alpha: Regularization parameter (e.g., 10)

% Create label comparison matrix
C1 = repmat(labels, 1, length(labels));
C2 = repmat(labels', length(labels), 1);
C = double(C1 == C2);

% LCFV-1 (Sparse)
[M1, W1] = solve_LCFV1(G, C, alpha);
lcfv_features = M1 * G;

% LCFV-2 (Dense)
M2 = solve_LCFV2(G, C, alpha);
lcfv_features = M2 * G;
```
